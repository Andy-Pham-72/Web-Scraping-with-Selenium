    "# Web Scraping with Selenium.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the other [repository](https://github.com/Andy-Pham-72/Web-Scraping-with-BeautifulSoup-and-Pandas), I introduced how to use Beautiful Soup to do a variety of quick and simple web-scraping tasks. Beautiful Soup is great, but it has its limitations, because sometimes the content we want to scrape is hidden behind buttons and links that we cannot access directly through a URL. There are also a variety of more sophisticated browsing tasks, like filling in forms and text boxes, that we might have the need to automate. For these purposes it is good to reach for another package: `selenium`\n",
    "\n",
    "[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is actually much more than a Python package; it's a whole framework for automating web browsers for the purposes of testing web applications, and it's been ported to a variety of programming languages in addition to Python. The main reason you should be aware of this is because, if you ever need to Google something about Selenium, you should include Selenium *and* Python in your search query; otherwise you will probably get a lot of results in Java (and who wants that). Also, if you ever have any questions about Selenium, their [unofficial documentation](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html) is always a good place to start."
